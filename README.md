# Kanban Board

A simple and interactive Kanban board built using **React** and **React Router** to manage tasks based on their statuses and priorities. This project demonstrates the organization of tasks, with user-specific task allocation, and offers features like drag-and-drop functionality and dynamic updates.

## Features

- **Dynamic Task Management**: Tasks can be categorized based on their priority and status (e.g., `To-Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`).
- **User Task Allocation**: Each task can be assigned to a specific user and the board dynamically groups tasks based on users.
- **Prioritized Tasks**: Tasks are automatically sorted by priority, with high-priority tasks placed at the top.
- **Responsive Layout**: The board layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with React for smooth and efficient rendering.
